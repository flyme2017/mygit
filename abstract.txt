	Human-powered augmentation lower exoskeleton is a kind of intelligent wearable equipment for personal 
help. It involves the fields of robot technology, mechanics, communication technology, computer science and 
automatic control. It is a hot topic at home and abroad. The technology aims to achieve the purpose of 
reducing the weight and reducing the energy consumption for the wearer through the intelligent design of 
man-machine integration.
	As a wearable system, reliability, battery life, human-computer interaction and power efficiency of 
human-powered augmentation lower exoskeleton are often the basic issues which developer consider. Based 
on these basic requirements, this paper designs and builds the hardware and software development platform 
of the power board, completes the hardware abstraction layer of the power board based on Canopen, and
analyzes the SDF file on the core board. 
	this is abstract of my file.
